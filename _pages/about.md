I am a **third-year PhD student at UC San Diego** at the NeuroML Lab. My research asks a straightforward question in plain terms: *how do modern language models organize and pass information around, and in what ways does that echo how the brain processes the same inputs?* 

Prior to this, my work spanned **production backend software engineering**, a **trading desk at an investment bank**, **materials research and device physics for energy-efficient computing**, and studies of **how post-training affects AI safety**; I now focus on **interpretability** and **brain–model comparisons**.

In my spare time, I'm an avid sports enthusiast, enjoying squash, bouldering, surfing, and hitting the gym. I am also an open water scuba diver, and discussions about diving never fail to get me excited!:)

Beyond sports, I'm an eclectic reader, enjoying everything from fantasy fiction to books on commodity trading. Please do check out my <a href = 'https://shaan-shah.github.io/readinglist/'>reading list</a>!
