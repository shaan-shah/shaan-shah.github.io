I am a first-year PhD student at UC San Diego working in hardware-software co-design for Neuromorphic Computing. Before this, I graduated from IIT Bombay with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering.

As an undergraduate researcher at the <a href = 'https://nanomemorylogic.wordpress.com/'>MeLoDe</a> lab, I worked on tuning Liquid State Machines for speech processing. I was also a research intern at <a href = 'https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/'>IISC</a>, contributing to a deep learning-based tool that helps ecologists track animals in the wild.

I interned at <a href = 'https://home.barclays/'>Barclays</a>, working at the Delta-1 trading desk to develop predictive models for Swiss and Italian benchmark indices. Additionally, I interned as a backend software engineer at <a href = 'https://truckx.com/'>TruckX</a>, a startup offering IoT solutions for fleet management.

In my spare time, I'm an avid sports enthusiast, enjoying squash, bouldering, surfing, and hitting the gym. I am also an open water scuba diver, and discussions about diving never fail to get me excited!:)

Beyond sports, I'm an eclectic reader, enjoying everything from fantasy fiction to books on commodity trading. Please do check out my reading list!
